0.2.0 - 01.06.07
 * SigGen
    IT IS SUGGESTED TO START FRESH, I REALLY MEAN IT! 
    Delete the entire SigGen folder, and drop the table `roster_addon_siggen` 
    An upgrade is available, but not suggested 
    If you do upgrade, make sure you still delete the siggen folder 
    The location of images have changed drastically 
    If you do not reset settings, you can still do so from the config panel if errors occur 
    o Fixed: Hiding of Riding skill
    o Added: Limited support for image packs
       background, character, class, pvp, frames (kinda), levelbubble (kinda), and borders (kinda) 
    o Added: .gif .jpg image support (.gif not available on backgrounds)
       Custom uploaded images can also be .gif, .jpg, or .png 
       The custom image code searches for image types in this order [.png > .gif > .jpg] 
    o Added: Partial localization, the errors and information displayed in SigGen can now be localized, the rest to come soon
    o Added: Settings import and export added, share your SigGen creations or back them up!
    o Changed: SigGen now honors transparency in .png backgrounds
       Implemented a pixel-by-pixel copy scheme that fails with .gif images Sad 
    o Changed: Moved "SigGen Works" to SigGen config, it is no longer in conf.php
    o Changed: Using proper "direct file access" protection
    o Changed: Guild Info is now pulled from the Roster global $guild_info 
 * SigGen Config
    o Fixed: Config gets the settings after reset, like it's supposed to, again
    o Fixed: Upgrade check moved so you can't upload/delete images or reset before upgrading
    o Added: Version number now shows in config panel
    o Added: Remote version checking
       SigGen now checks if there is a newer version available for download 
    o Changed: Fonts and Color config are gone!
       Each font and color field is now set separately 
 * SigGen.php
    o Fixed: ini_set() usability is checked before it is used
    o Changed: Error system greatly improved
       Errors will now display as an image, so you do not have to right click on the image, and open in another window to see the error 
       If there is a problem with the error image, it will default back to text mode 
    o Changed: Improved the getEnglishValue() function some
       It will scan every main Roster locale installed 
 * New weirdness in this version
    o Selecting a new background image pack will reset all options for background images
       + You MUST reset all the options when changing the background image pack 
    o Selecting a new character image pack will reset the default character image option
       + You MUST reset this when changing the character image pack 
    o Uploading to Roster with UniUploader is still broken
       + I do have an idea on how to fix, just give me some time...
